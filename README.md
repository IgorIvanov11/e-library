# e-library
A digital library site that I made in 2 days as a project work at university. I don't really like the frontend here, but by spending another day or two you can make it look nice. But otherwise it's a good example of a digital library. This site has different levels of access depending on the user (add new books, change their parameters and so on). 
To run this site on your computer, download XAMPP (run Apache and MySQL). Put the whole project structure in \Program Files\XAMPP\htdocs 
Then go to: localhost in your browser. Run PHP My Admin and import the database from the db folder (or create your own).

The upload folder (it is empty) will store books that users will upload to the site.
